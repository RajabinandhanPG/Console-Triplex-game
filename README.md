# Console-Triplex-game

Console-Triplex-game is a simple math-based game where players need to guess a numerical code based on provided clues.

## Features

- **Level Progression:** The game features level progression, meaning that as the player advances, the code becomes progressively harder to crack.

- **Level Cap:** The level progression is capped at level 3 by default, but you can easily edit the code to allow for an infinite number of levels if desired.

- **Randomized Code:** The encrypted code is highly randomized. It is generated based on the current time, ensuring that each game provides a unique challenge.
